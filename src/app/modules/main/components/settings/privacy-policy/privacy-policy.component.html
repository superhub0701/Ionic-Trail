Your continued use of the App following the effective date hereinabove means you accept the changes. You agree that notices we may provide on the App itself shall be deemed reasonable notice for this purpose. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we may make to this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">1. Collected and Disclosed Information</h3>
  <p>
    1.1 Avenues may request information from you in order to grant you access to selected content of the App. Avenues may use this information to contact you regarding your relationship with the App and to provide services that you have requested. Avenues may share your information with vendors we select as necessary to provide products or services you have requested or to provide information about products or services that may be of interest to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.2 Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, your personal information will not be used for promotional purposes without your consent. However, if you choose to fill out any user surveys, or participate in a contest, demographic information that you submit about yourself may be shared with associated sponsors and business partners in aggregate form.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.3 Information collected in aggregate form includes the number of visitors to the App, how long they stay, the pages they visit, the trails and locations they select, anonymized review content and trail share statistics. Avenues collects these kinds of aggregate user information to help continually improve content and services, and to sell sponsorships of the App to appropriate advertisers. This aggregate user information is disclosed to advertisers, but note that advertisers do not have any influence over the editorial content or reviews that appear on the App. In addition, Avenues collects in aggregate form information from visitors who click on advertisements to enable measurement of interest in the various areas of the App and inform advertisers as to how many visitors have seen or clicked on their ads. Avenues also uses demographic and preference information in aggregate form only to allow advertising banners on the App to be targeted to the readers for whom they are most pertinent.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.4 Avenues cooperates with all law-enforcement inquiries, official investigations and legal proceedings initiated by governmental and/or law enforcement officials, and reserves the right to disclose personally identifying and/or aggregate information in connection with a subpoena or other court-sanctioned demand for such information.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.5 Nothing in this Privacy Policy is meant to impede Avenues’ right or ability to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets. Avenues reserves the right to share your information with any successor to Avenues’ business, subject to acceptance by said any successor of all obligations under this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

    1.6 Avenues reserves the right to use the information it collects about your computer, mobile or other device (including its geographical location), which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including, without limitation, to help diagnosis problems with its servers, to gather broad demographic information, analyze trends, track users' movements around the App and to otherwise administer the App. Geographic location information about you and/or your computer, mobile or other device may specifically be used to show you content and sponsored messaging based on geographic location. Avenues reserves the right to use, transfer, sell and share aggregated anonymous data about its users as a group for any lawful business purpose, such as analyzing usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers, sponsors, clients and customers.

Avenues reserves the right to place cookies on your computer with unique anonymous numbers for purposes such as to ensure that your browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a particular ad/or viAppd a particular web page. You may decline Local Device Storage by using the appropriate feature of your web software, if available; however, declining to use Local Device Storage may impede the ability of the App to function properly.

    should be aware that information disclosed in e-mails may not be secure or

  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">5. Social Networking Service</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to access, visit and/or use any third-party social networking service(s) that may be integrated with the App, Avenues may receive personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that you may have made available to those services, including information about your contacts on those services. For example, some social networking services allow you to push content from our App to your contacts or to pool information about your contacts so you can connect with them on or through our App. Some social networking services also will facilitate your registration for the App or enhance or personalize your experience on the App. Your decision to use a social networking service in connection with the App is voluntary. However, you should make sure you are comfortable with the information your third-party social networking services may make available to the App by visiting those service(s) privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy setting directly with those services. Avenues applies the terms of this Privacy Policy to all personally identifiable information and other information about you and your computer, mobile or other device that it receives through third-party social networking services.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ion-text-left">6. Third-Party Web Apps</h3>
  <p>
    6.1 The App contains links to other web Apps that are not under our control, even though some of them may feature the Avenues logo through a marketing agreement with us. Avenues cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. This Privacy Policy does not cover information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline and online Apps, applications, destinations or services linked to or from the App. It is recommended that you review the privacy policy of any web App you visit. 
  </p>
  <p>
    6.2 On occasion, Avenues sponsors special promotions, sweepstakes, and contests that are hosted by partner web Apps, which may require that your browser accept cookies, or that you agree to receive information from such sponsors. Please note that 6.1 is fully applicable to said partner web Apps.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">7. Security</h3>
  <p>
    Avenues takes highly serious security measures designed to guard access to information, data quality, and physical security of servers where information is stored. The App has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control and uses encryption technology where appropriate. Avenues cannot, however, guarantee the confidentiality of any communication transmitted to or from Avenues via the App or e-mails. Accordingly, Avenues is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet.
  </p>
  <h3 class="ion-text-left">8. Notice to California Residents</h3>
