  <p>
    1.1 These terms and conditions are effective immediately for users registering an Avenues account after the date of last update hereinabove and will become effective 30 days after said date for pre-existing users. These are the App terms and conditions ("Terms"), which apply to the use by end users of the Avenues App, hereinafter referred to as the “App”, owned and operated by the Delaware Corporation Metomine LLC, hereinafter referred to as “Avenues” or “we”, “us” or “our”. 
  </p>
  <p>
    1.2 By accessing the App you agree to be bound by: (i) the Terms; and (ii) the Avenues Privacy Policy, which is found on the App and incorporated herein for reference. If you do not agree to the Terms or the Avenues Privacy Policy you are not entitled to enter the App.
  </p>
  <p>
    1.3 The Terms constitute an agreement between us and contain the entire terms of your use of the App and all matters which are referred to herein. The Terms supersede any prior written or oral agreement between us relating to such matters. We may change the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion and your continued use of the App following the effective date hereinabove means you agree to be bound by such changes. You agree that notices we may provide on the App itself shall be deemed reasonable notice for this purpose. It is your responsibility to check periodically for any changes we may make to the Terms. Nothing in the Terms shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.
  </p>

    1.4 You confirm that, in agreeing to accept the Terms, you have not relied on any representation that is not expressly included in the Terms. You may only use the App for your personal and non-commercial use.

  </p>

  <h3 class="ion-text-left">2. Grant of License</h3>

    This Agreement provides you with a personal, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use as end-user the App subject to your continued compliance with the Terms.

    3.1 In order to use some parts of the App, you may need to create an account. You must never use the account of another user without obtaining their prior consent. You must provide full and accurate information when you create your account with us. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and so we suggest that you keep your account password secure.

    3.2 When joining Avenues via a user account you will be asked to create an account which you can do via a number of social network accounts or with an email address and secure password. When logging in or creating an account via a social network a Avenues appointed supplier will ask the nominated application for permission to access selected data, which enables the service to work. This data is stored by Avenues against your profile. When you login to the App using social networks the application will check for any changes to your personal information stored by the App and update your App profile accordingly. If you choose to delete your App account all your data is deleted from the App immediately.
